My pokedeck is setted as a console interface. When you start it you can choose what action you'd like to perform.

A deck is automatically created at launch. And one of the first action you need to do is to create your cards by typing "addCard".

When you gave all the asked information for the creation, the other actions got an interest.

After that you can consult your all deck with "getDeck" and see all the informations. You can also change the description of a pokemon by choosing the card. In the same way, you can add an attack on a specific pokemon with his name, descritpion and damages.
